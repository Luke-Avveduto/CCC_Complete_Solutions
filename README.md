# CCC_Complete_Solutions
My solutions to the problems found in various years of the Canadian Computing Competition hosted by the University of Waterloo.

I hope to one day complete all of the problems both to practice programming, as well to provide (hopefully) half helpful solutions to others looking to learn how to do these.
